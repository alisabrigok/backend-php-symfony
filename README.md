# Some Back-End Work

This application fetches some currencies from two different API endpoints, compares them and saves the smallest ones into a **MySQL** database via an implementation of **adapter design pattern**.

All these operations can be executed using `app:currency-comparison` command or more precisely using: `php bin/console app:currency-comparison` command. By accessing to homepage, the values will be retrieved from database and shown in a table. The project made with using **PHP** and **Symfony** framework.
