The command can be executed by typing `app:currency-comparison`
More precisely: `php bin/console app:currency-comparison`

**Note:** I know I'm suppose to insert the data to database if there is no value in the database and update if they exist but I couldn't do it within time so instead I remove all data each time and re-insert.

**Final Words:** This is all I was able to do using a framework and a language that I'm not really comfortable with within 3 days but I hope it might at least say something about my learning skills to some degree.

Thanks for the spent time to evaluate me.

Regards.
